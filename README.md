An Object-Oriented Approach Using C++ uses a combination of thorough well-ordered explanations and a strong visual framework to make programming concepts accessible to students. The authors stress incremental program development wherein program analysis is followed by building a structure chart constructing UML flow diagrams writing algorithms undertaking program design and finally testing. This foundation combined with a focus on the benefits of a consistent and well-documented programming style prepares students to tackle the academic and professional programming challenges they will encounter down the road with confidence.
